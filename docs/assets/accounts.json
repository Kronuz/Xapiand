Her deceitful ways and neglectful nature pose plenty of problems and just affect all around negatively. Fortunately her sense of balance helps make sure these days are few and far between.",

Many occasions were spoiled because of this and her irritable nature, which is unfortunate in and of itself. All in all, Stephanie does have some endearing sides. She's efficient and reflective among true friends, it's not like we've encountered the devil. Unfortunately her abrasiveness tends to ruin whatever good comes from those traits.",
