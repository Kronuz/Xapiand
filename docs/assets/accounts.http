To make things worse he's also pretentious, abrasive and irresponsible, but at least those are kept somewhat in check by habits of being daring as well. But focus on his as this is what he's pretty much \u00ba. There's a great deal of pain left on all sides because of this and his power-hungry ways, much to the annoyance of others. Fair is fair though, Kenneth is complex and grey like the rest of us. He's selfless and active if nothing else, it's not like we've encountered the devil. Unfortunately his agonizing nature is almost ever present and ready to sour the mood."}

There's no sugar coating the effects caused because of this and her intolerance, but that may just be the nature of the beast. Fair is fair though, Christine does gave some redeeming qualities. She's independent and optimistic among true friends, it's not like we're dealing with pure evil here. Unfortunately her destructive nature will probably never truly go away."}

Nobody's perfect of course and Phillip has rotten moods and days too. His intolerance and power-hungry ways aren't exactly fun to deal with and reach all around.
