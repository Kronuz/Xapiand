# Kronuz Discussions Worker

Multi-tenant blog comments on Cloudflare Workers, Hono, and D1. A deployment can
serve any number of blogs. The tenant is the first URL segment:

```text
https://comments.example.com/my-blog
```

For first deployment, OAuth setup, verification, and future tenant procedures, follow
[TUTORIAL.md](./TUTORIAL.md).

For routine D1 inspection, backups, migrations, logs, tenant administration, recovery,
and troubleshooting, use [OPERATIONS.md](./OPERATIONS.md).

Every tenant owns its complete site, origin, OAuth, moderator, widget, limit,
notification, and feed configuration. Reading is public when `accessKey` is empty and
capability-protected otherwise. Authentication is required to post, react, edit, or
moderate.

An empty top-level `accessKey` makes a tenant public. A 32-byte base64url value protects
all browser-facing tenant operations behind the `X-Discussions-Key` header. The key is a
static site capability, not per-reader authorization.

## Configuration model

Management has two operations:

```text
GET /:tenant/config   public widget configuration
PUT /:tenant/config   authenticated upsert of the complete private configuration
```

There is no delete operation. Set `active` to `false` in a full `PUT` to take a tenant
offline without removing its discussions, comments, or reactions. A later full `PUT` with
`active: true` restores it.

The complete configuration is AES-GCM encrypted in D1 with `CONFIG_MASTER_KEY`. Public
`GET` returns a strict projection and never exposes OAuth credentials, webhook URLs, feed
tokens, moderators, or origins. See `tenant-config.example.json` for every option.

Only deployment-wide infrastructure stays outside tenant configuration:

| binding | purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `DB` | D1 database |
| `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` | Worker origin, without a tenant path |
| `REQUEST_MAX_BYTES` | hard service request-size ceiling |
| `SESSION_SECRET` | signs tenant-bound sessions and OAuth state |
| `CONFIG_MASTER_KEY` | encrypts complete tenant documents in D1 |
| `SERVICE_ADMIN_TOKEN` | authorizes `PUT /:tenant/config` |

The last three are Worker secrets. Losing `CONFIG_MASTER_KEY` makes stored tenant
configuration unrecoverable. Back it up securely.

For deployment, they may be placed in a gitignored `secrets.sh`. An empty
`SESSION_SECRET` preserves an existing remote value; on a fresh deployment, `deploy.sh`
generates one. Non-empty `CONFIG_MASTER_KEY` and `SERVICE_ADMIN_TOKEN` values are used
when those remote secrets do not exist yet.

## Local development

```bash
npm install
cp wrangler.toml.example wrangler.toml
cp .dev.vars.example .dev.vars
npm run migrate:local
npm run dev
```

Create a tenant in the local Worker:

```bash
cp tenant-config.example.json tenant-config.json
# Fill every value, including OAuth credentials.
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8787/my-blog/config \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer dev-local-service-admin-token-change-me' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-binary @tenant-config.json
```

For the usual blog workflow, Astro continues using the production Worker and production
comments during `npm run dev`. Register both `http://localhost:4321` and
`http://127.0.0.1:4321` in that production tenant's `origins` array. OAuth still returns
to the production callback, then the signed state sends the reader back to localhost.

## Production deployment

```bash
npx wrangler login
cp wrangler.toml.example wrangler.toml
# Set PUBLIC_BASE_URL and, for an existing D1 database, database_id.
./deploy.sh
```

After deployment, copy and fill `tenant-config.example.json`, then send the full document:

```bash
curl -X PUT https://comments.example.com/my-blog/config \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <SERVICE_ADMIN_TOKEN>' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-binary @tenant-config.json
```

Register this callback with that tenant's OAuth client:

```text
https://comments.example.com/my-blog/auth/callback
```

The blog needs only the tenant base URL:

```ts
export const DISCUSSIONS_BACKEND =
  "https://comments.example.com/my-blog";
```

## Tenant API

```text
GET  /:tenant/config
PUT  /:tenant/config

GET  /:tenant/auth/login
POST /:tenant/auth/login
GET  /:tenant/auth/callback
POST /:tenant/auth/logout

GET  /:tenant/api/me
GET  /:tenant/api/discussions
POST /:tenant/api/comments
POST /:tenant/api/comments/edit
POST /:tenant/api/comments/delete
POST /:tenant/api/comments/hide
POST /:tenant/api/preview
POST /:tenant/api/react

GET  /:tenant/comments/feed?token=...
GET  /health
```

The path selects a tenant. For browser API and login requests, the request or return
origin must also appear in that tenant's complete configuration. Sessions, cookies, rate
limits, and browser local-storage keys are tenant-scoped.

## Verification

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm test
npx wrangler deploy --dry-run
```
