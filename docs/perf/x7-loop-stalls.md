# x7-loop-stalls: what holds an HTTP loop past 1 ms, and where RESTORE's time goes

> Status: DRAFT (2026-11-11) profiles of master's code; measurement only, no product change. Quest x7-loop-stalls A1.

Question: x7-gate (`docs/gates/phase7c.md` at Xapiand:df5eb9e06) misses T4 (every HTTP loop's p99 lag 24.6-28.7 ms
against the 1,024 us edge), T5 (loaded light p99 76.8 ms), T10's flood (p99 50.9 ms) and T12's RESTORE (0.288x pre-7c).
Which work holds a loop, for how long and how often, and where does RESTORE's time go against pre-7c?

## Method

- Binaries: x7-gate's build job 261111-171014-19268b, RelWithDebInfo, `-fno-omit-frame-pointer`, LTO off. Head is
  Xapiand:49ebb4481, whose `src/` equals master's (`git diff 49ebb4481 master -- src` is empty); pre-7c is
  Xapiand:142b2ca77. Copies at `$HOME/.scratch/x7-loop-stalls/<commit>/xapiand` (same shasum as the job's).
- Host: macOS 15.8.1, Intel Core i9-9980HK, 8 cores, 16 logical CPUs. Head runs 16 reactors, pre-7c 10 (each binary's default).
- Load: x7-gate's `harness/stall_load.py` at Xapiand:234fe089a (20,000 `accounts`, light open loop at 200/s, heavy
  closed loop at 4x the reactors: two aggregations, a wildcard, a phrase and a text search, plus one RESTORE stream into
  `restore-target`). RESTORE alone: x7-gate's `harness/profile_bulk.sh --mult 20`.
- Profiler: `sample(1)` at 1 ms. A thread's sample counts wall time in a non-idle stack (a leaf outside `kevent`,
  `__psynch_cvwait`, `os_sync_wait_on_address` and other waits), so it is wall on the thread, not CPU.
- Lag: the loops' own `reactor::LagProbe` (`xapiand_reactor_lag_seconds`), a 1 ms timer whose lateness is binned in
  log2 buckets with 4 sub-buckets; a percentile is its bucket's upper edge.
- Analyzer: a parser of `sample`'s call graph (per-thread busy counts, inclusive and leaf shares by frame).

## RESTORE: one reactor does all of it

Source: x7-gate's t12b job 261111-171048-c39d8d (exclusive, 3 ABBA pairs; `bulk/pb-<i>-<arm>.sample.txt` in its output).
Head restores 1,999-2,161 docs/s, pre-7c 7,039-7,866 (head/pre 0.284, range 0.274-0.284) while head spends 0.81x
pre-7c's CPU per document (0.609-0.664 against 0.751-0.818 ms, user plus system).

**Cause.** Head prepares and applies every object on the reactor that accepted the request, one after another
(`DocIndexer::index`, `src/database/handler.cc`: `co_await index_one(...)` per object, a checkpoint between objects).
That reactor thread is in a non-idle stack for 83-86% of the profile window in all three head arms (5,858 of 6,816,
5,569 of 6,731 and 5,568 of 6,666 samples), which is all of the restore: the window also holds node start and the
load's tail. Every other thread is mostly parked: the 16 `W` workers together have 1,457 busy samples (fsync and
`fcntl` of the chores), the WAL thread 1,123. So RESTORE runs at the speed of one thread, about 0.5 ms of loop wall per
document (10.2 s of the window's loop wall over 20,000 documents). Pre-7c spread the same work over 10 `DP` (prepare)
threads, 691-837 busy samples each, and 5 busy `DI` (index) threads, 667-1,293 each; its critical thread (`DI23`)
waited on the shard's writable checkout 40.5% of its timeline.

Where the loop's time goes (head, arm 2; arms 3 and 6 in parentheses), as shares of the loop's busy samples:

| Work on the loop | Share | Note |
|---|---:|---|
| `engine::strata::Shard::replace` (the shard's turn) | 45.1% (54.0, 52.8) | of which `finalise_write` 34.3% (44.2, 43.6) |
| `finalise_write`: decompress the record, set `_version`, recompress | 34.3% | `Data::get_obj` 6.2% (zstd decompress 4.2%), `Data::set_obj` 19.2% (zstd compress 16.2%), `MsgPack::serialise` 2.5% |
| `Schema::index` (fields, terms) | 29.3% (23.3, 23.2) | `GenerateTerms::text` 10.6% |
| strata apply (`apply_settling`, `basic_index::apply`) | 5.4% (4.0, 4.3) | |
| `DatabaseHandler::prepare` (outside `Schema::index`) | 5.2% (3.4, 2.9) | compresses the record once: 2.7% |
| zstd in total | 23.1% (28.8, 28.6) | 18.9% compress, 4.2% decompress |

`finalise_write` (`src/database/shard.cc`) is the same code in pre-7c: it reads the record that `prepare` already
compressed, changes `_version` (and `_id` for a new numeric id) and compresses it again. Pre-7c paid it on the `DI`
threads in parallel; head pays it on the one loop.
