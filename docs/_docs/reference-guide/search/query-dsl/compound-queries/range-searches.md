title: Range Searches
---

The keyword `_range` matches documents where the given value is between the
given `_from` and `_to` fixed range (including both endpoints).

If you only use the keyword `_from` matches documents where the given value is
greater than or equal to a fixed value.

If you only use the keyword `_to` matches documents where the given value is
less than or equal a fixed value.

#### Example

This example find _all_ bank accounts for which their account holders are
_females_ in the ages between 20 and 30:

{% capture req %}

```json
GET /bank/:search

{
  "_query": {
    "_and": [
      { "gender": "female" },
      {
        "age": {
          "_in": {
            "_range": {
              "_from": 20,
              "_to": 30
            }
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
{% endcapture %}
{% include curl.html req=req %}
