### Why I don't see the responses when I create/update objects?
For performance reasons, newly created or edited objects are not returned in
the response. If you wish to get objects echoed in the response, turn on the
`--echo` option, pass `?echo` query param or increase verbosity to level 4 or
higher (`-vvvv` or --verbosity=4).


---
### Why the responses are unformatted JSON one-liners?
For performance reasons, to see pretty formatted responses use `--pretty`
option, pass `?pretty` query param or increase verbosity to level 4 or higher
(`-vvvv` or --verbosity=4).
