Getting Xapiand installed and ready-to-go should only take a few minutes.
If it ever becomes a pain, please [file an issue]({{ site.repository }}/issues/new)

we might make the process easier.


## Homebrew

Xapiand contains a formula for Homebrew (a package manager for OS X). It can
be installed by using the following command:

```sh
brew install --HEAD https://github.com/Kronuz/Xapiand/raw/master/contrib/homebrew/xapiand.rb
```


## Linux

```sh
(not available)
```


## Building

You can also build and install from the sources if there's no other way. You can
find information about how to build from the sources [here](/docs/building).
