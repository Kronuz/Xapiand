This documentation aims to be a comprehensive guide to Xapiand. We'll cover
topics such as getting your site up and running, indexing and searching
documents, customizing data schemas, deploying to various environments, and
give you some advice on participating in the future development of Xapiand
itself.


## So what is Xapiand, exactly?

Xapiand is *A Modern Highly Available Distributed RESTful Search and Storage
Engine built for the Cloud and with Data Locality in mind*. It takes JSON
(or MessagePack) documents and indexes them efficiently for later retrieval.
